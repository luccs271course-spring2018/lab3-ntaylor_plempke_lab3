#TestIteratorQuestions:
 
#also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
#It will take longer to run with a LinkedList as it reaches the end of the list
 
#what happens if you use list.remove(77)?
#since it looks for the list value of 77 it will return an error since it is out of
#bounds for the list size
 
#TestListQuestions:
 
#Also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
#No, using a LinkedList does not make a difference
 
#What does this method do?
#doesn't remove item 5 it removes the item below it
 
#list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)); // what does this one do?
#This will remove the integer value of 5 from your list
